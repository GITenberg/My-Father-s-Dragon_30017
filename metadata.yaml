description: "My Father's Dragon is a children's novel by Ruth Stiles Gannett about\
  \ a young boy, Elmer Elevator, who runs away to Wild Island to rescue a baby dragon.\
  \ Both a Newbery Honor Book and an ALA Notable Book, it is the first book of a trilogy\
  \ whose other titles are Elmer and the Dragon and The Dragons of Blueland. All three\
  \ were published in a 50-year anniversary edition as Three Tales of My Father's\
  \ Dragon. It was made into an anime film titled, Elmer's Adventures: My Father's\
  \ Dragon.\nThe narrative mode is unusual, in that the narrator refers to the protagonist\
  \ only as \"my father\", giving the impression that this is a true story that happened\
  \ long ago. The other two books in the trilogy are narrated in the third person.\n\
  The illustrations within the book are black and white done with a grease crayon\
  \ on a grained paper, done by Ruth Chrisman Gannett, who also illustrated other\
  \ children's books such as My Mother Is the Most Beautiful Woman in the World, Paco\
  \ Goes to the Fair, Miss Hickory, Hipo the Hippo, and adult books such as Tortilla\
  \ Flat by John Steinbeck and Cream Hill by Lewis Stiles Gannett, the author's father\
  \ and husband of the book's illustrator.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
